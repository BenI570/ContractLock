Our idea is called Contract Lock. The inspiration for the project is the uncertainty that arises from planning trips that involve multiple parties paying money to a group fund. Our software employs blockchain technology to ensure that users can securely deposit money that will be stored in an impartial, intermediate smart contract on the blockchain. The smart contract has two main features, a deadline that stops people from withdrawing money until a certain date and time, and a beneficiary that will be able to claim the money once everyone has paid their part. The payers will only be able to withdraw the money they put in after the deadline if all payers have not paid. Our project works with the Flare Testnet Coston2 and MetaMask (a popular crypto wallet) to securely handle the exchange of currency.
